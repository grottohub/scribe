# scribe

This is the source code for my bot `scribe`, which I use to test my Discord library [Glyph](https://github.com/grottohub/glyph).

If you want to know how to implement something in Glyph, this is probably the best place to look. I'll do my best to keep this up to date with new examples and features in cadence with Glyph releases.

Further documentation for Glyph can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/glyph>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
